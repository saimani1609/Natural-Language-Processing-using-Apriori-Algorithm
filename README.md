Natural Language Processing using Apriori Algorithm


Natural Language Processing using Stanford NLP and tf-idf Algorithm and Calculation of Association Rules 
between Keywords using Apriori Algorithm


The programming concept of this project is following the procedure described below:
1. Get documents from sgm files.
2. Use Stanford NLP to eliminate all the stopwords provided in “stopwords.txt”
3. Get the base case(lemma) of all the remaining words as potential keywords
4. Calculate tf-idf of each words and select top k words(number of k can vary) as keywords
5. Create table of documents with these keywords 
6. Use Apriori algorithm to calculate all the association rules.
